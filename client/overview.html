        <p class="sectorOverview">India is the world’s largest producer of dairy products by volume, accounting for more than 13% of world’s total milk production, and it also has the world’s largest dairy herd. As the country consumes almost all of its own milk production, India was neither an active importer nor an exporter of dairy products prior to year 2000. However, since the implementation of Operation Flood Programme, the situation changed significantly and imports of dairy products reduced to very small quantities. From 2001, India has become a net exporter of dairy products and after 2003 India’s dairy import has dipped while exports have increased at a fast rate. Yet the country’s share in global dairy trade still remains at minor levels of 0.3 and 0.4 percent for exports and imports respectively. </p>

        <p class="sectorOverview">India is a minor player in the international dairy market. Prior to the 1970s, India was primarily an import dependent country and anhydrous milk fat, butter and dry milk powders were imported to meet the needs of urban consumers. From 2001, India has become a net exporter of dairy products. After 2003, India’s dairy import has dipped while exports have increased rapidly, yet the country’s share in global dairy trade still remains at minor levels of 0.3 and 0.4 percent for exports and imports respectively. This is due to the direct consumption of liquid milk by the producer households as well as the demand for processed dairy products that has increased with the growth of income levels. <br/>around half of India’s total dairy import by volume consist of butter and other dairy derived fats, followed by lactose (33 percent), and milk powder (eight percent) .Almost all of India’s dairy exports go to Asian and African countries. </p>

        <p class="sectorOverview">Dairy Cooperatives account for the major share of processed liquid milk marketed in the India. Milk is processed and marketed by 170 Milk Producers’ Cooperative Unions, which federate into 15 State Cooperative Milk Marketing Federations. Over the years, several brands have been created by cooperatives like Amul (GCMMF), Vijaya (AP), Verka (Punjab), Saras (Rajasthan). Nandini (Karnataka), Milma (Kerala) and Gokul (Kolhapur).</p>

          <p class="sectorOverview">India places emphasis on both cow and buffalo milk. Out of all bovine population in India, 40 percent are indigenous cows, 46 percent are buffaloes and 14 percent are imported European or North American cattle crossbreeds. Out of the nation’s total milk production, about 55 percent comes from buffaloes, and the remainder from dairy cows. Traditionally, buffalo milk has been preferred for its high milk fat content. However, as the organised sector procures more milk, dairy cattle becoming more popular due to their increased yields and shorter dry periods.</p>
